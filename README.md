## About

I was looking for a way to keep my documentation updated with my Zod schemas. To my surprise, I couldn't find any tool that would output a string representation of a Zod schema. So I decided to write my own. You can use this tool either as a library or as a CLI.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @jackdbd/zod-to-doc
```

> This project uses [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) and [api-documenter markdown](https://api-extractor.com/pages/commands/api-documenter_markdown/) to generate a bunch of markdown files and a `.d.ts` rollup file containing all type definitions consolidated into a single file. I don't find this `.d.ts` rollup file particularly useful. On the other hand, the markdown files that api-documenter generates are quite handy when reviewing the public API of this project.

## Examples

Here are some tables generated using a couple of Zod schemas exported by [fixtures/schemas.mjs](https://github.com/jackdbd/zod-to-doc/blob/main/fixtures/schemas.mjs).

### Usage as a CLI

Zod to Doc can be used as a CLI. For example, if you run this command and have the correct placeholder in your document (see this `README.md` in raw mode):

```sh
ztd --module ./fixtures/schemas.mjs \
  --schema car \
  --placeholder car-table \
  --title '#### Car table'
```

You get this output:

<!-- BEGIN car-table -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN ztd TO UPDATE -->

#### Car table

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `manufacturer` | `undefined` | Car manufacturer |
| `model` | `undefined` | Car model |
| `tires` | `undefined` | Array of 4 elements |
| `year` | `undefined` | Year in which the car was manufactured |
<!-- END car-table -->

<!-- Same example, but using [transclude](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/transclude). -->

### Usage as a library

Zod to Doc can also be used as a library. For example, the [readme.ts](https://github.com/jackdbd/zod-to-doc/blob/main/readme.ts) file in this repository uses `markdownTableFromZodSchema` to replace a mustache-style placeholder with this markdown table:

#### Car tire table

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `manufacturer` | `undefined` | Car tire manufacturer |
| `pressure` | `30` | Car tire pressure in PSI |

## Troubleshooting

This package uses the [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) library for logging.
You can control what's logged using the `DEBUG` environment variable.

For example, if you set your environment variables in a `.envrc` file, you can do:

```sh
# print all logging statements
export DEBUG=ztd:*
```
