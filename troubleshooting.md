## Troubleshooting

This package uses the [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) library for logging.
You can control what's logged using the `DEBUG` environment variable.

For example, if you set your environment variables in a `.envrc` file, you can do:

```sh
# print all logging statements
export DEBUG=ztd:*
```
